# resize-image

Resize image allows to efficiently resize images in the browser prior to upload thanks to HTML5 canvas.

This module allows to resize files, thus making them smaller. Why wait for the file to be on the server before compressing it?

## How does it work?

Modern browsers have everything needed to resize images. That works in three steps:

1. take an image object (from input file) as input param
2. convert it into base64 dataUrl
3. "print" that image on a canvas of desired size (canvas isn't inserted in the DOM at all)
4. return the new image as base64 dataUrl


## Installation

### Bower

```
bower install resizeimage
```

### Manual

Download the archive and extract it. Then just link `resize-image.js` in your `<head>`:

    <script src="resize-image.js"></script>

## Can I haz the code?

__Yes sir!__

_You'll notice that this is ES6 code (so is the module, more details below), treat with caution._

```js
// get your input file (it has id="upload-image")
const inputFile = document.getElementById('upload-image');

// get the actual file object from your input field as soon as a file is selected
inputFile.onchange = function(event) {
   const img = inputFile.files[0];

	resizeImage(img, { outputFormat: 'jpeg', targetWidth: 200, targetHeight: 100 }, (err, b64img) => {
    	if (err) {
    	    console.error(err);
    	    return;
    	}

    	// do what you have to with the b64img
	});
});
```

### Parameters

The function takes three arguments:

- the image as a file object from input file
- options object
- callback

The options object takes several arguments:

- {string} outputFormat – (jpe?g or png)
- {string} targetWidth
- {string} targetHeight
- {bool} forceRatio – if true, force dimensions without regard to the aspect ratio (optional)



    

## ES6 comatibility without a build pipeline

The module is written is ES2015. If you want it compatible with (moderately) older browsers and don't have a build process, you'll have to [transpile it to ES5](https://es6console.com/). While you're at it, don't forget to uglify it for better delivery.
